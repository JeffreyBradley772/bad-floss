# Floss Reviews

A silly side project born from one too many bad floss experiences and a cheap domain.

Over time it evolved into:
- Building a small API service to work around Walmart’s not-so-great API
- Managing my own database of floss products
- Learning more about secure role management and automated deployment on AWS

That’s it, lightweight, a bit scrappy, and mostly for fun.
